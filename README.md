`flutter_acpanalytics` is a flutter plugin for the iOS and Android [AEP Analytics SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/previous-versions/documentation/adobe-analytics/) to allow for integration with flutter applications. Functionality to enable the Analytics extension is provided entirely through Dart documented below.
